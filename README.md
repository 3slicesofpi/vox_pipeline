Ideally simple 3d package visualiser using Python.

Constraints:
- Python implementation
- Basic Rendering, Interaction of actors only
- Actors are Cuboids of variable size and position.
- Stage is a Cuboid of variable size.

# Aliases
- Actors are Packages, or pkg.
- Stage is a Container, or con.

# Pipeline
- Get data from js file 
- ??? (Axes3D/mplt)
- profit!!


This should have been implemented in js.

TODO move the authorship info to metadata field(s).
